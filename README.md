# crop-yield-prediction
Factorial Files for crops cotten and Maize were generated using ElementTree module from xml package in python.

meterological data for simulations was collected from [data.telangana.gov.in](data.telangana.gov.in).

a regression model was used to predict solar radiation from temparature data. 

once factorial files were generated, the simulations were run using [Apsim](https://www.apsim.info/apsim-model/) Software.

once simulations were complete data was collected from output files and a yield prediction regression model was trained.
